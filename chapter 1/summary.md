# Chapter 1 Summary of Deep Learning from Scratch
## The summary policy
Mainly it will be noted in summary document (this) by each chapter folder, and new information, idea and concept to me recorded.
it is not get used to using mark-up document in github, however, one of study member offers to use jupyter or ipython. Still not getting what that it is though

## Basic Python use guide
It is better to refer another books. one fella of my study group suggested "Pythonic Coding Skills"- but don't know whether it is exactly same name in English as it is published in the Korea, and it is a direct transaltion.

## About using numpy
There is tensor, applying method to metrices. Just like the opperation of metrix with scalar value, it extends its scalar to fit the size of metrices. If the column is fit, then it extends 
the name of Tensorflow, one of famous tools for machine learning from google, is originated from here. The "Tensor" "Flow". The reason it is designated "Flow" is that, I guess, it is related to neural programming, like, the tensor is flowing through nueral network. it will be introduced further more from next chapter.


## Further Works
Getting used to plotting in python and numpy
