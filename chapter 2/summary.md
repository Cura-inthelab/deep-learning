# Chapter 2 Summary of Deep Learning from Scratch

## About Artificial Nueral Programming
There will be neuron, and there be tensor. 

However, how do make it to think and determine meaningful output result?

Given b = W_1*x_1 + W_2*x2
"""if b > T then f(a)=1, else if b <= T tehn f(b)=0"""
Where T is threshould value, b is , a is argument,  f(a) is output, W_n is weight for each nueron, x_n is input.

By finding proper W_1, W_2, W_3... we can get "trained nuerons", so what we should do is finding weight for each input.

i.e.) There is four nueron, and output results 1 when two input is 1, else it is 0. what weight values should be?

*Wish I would no why the four is appropriate number of nuerons.

The answers, combinations of W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, are vary and many, not just one solution.

At this point, I realized why data business will be abundant. If we have trained nueron for certain purpose, the thing is only data, not logic. the combinations of weight will serve what we want.

But only one nueron network cannot be a solution of XOR. Also, as it mentioned, it should be trained by human. Next chapter it will show the way to find a solution of them such as multi nueral network, and automated training.

It is getting more interesting through chapter by chapter.
